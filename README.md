# How to run The ATM App

To run this project, download or clone the repo and navigate to it within your terminal/directory.

This project requires Node.js to be installed. Im using: 

$ node --version
v14.15.0

An adequate version of npm is required (or yarn but npm is suggested). Here's the adequate version I use:

$ npm --version
6.14.11


## Install app

In the project directory (within the atm-app folder), you can run:

### `npm install`

To install all the node modules required.

## `Start the appliction`

To start the application in the directory (wihtin the atm-app folder), you can run:

### `npm start`

The application should run in browser and you should be greeted with the splash screen 
'Please insert your card to continue.'

Click on the card to insert and once at the pin screen, using the number pad (not keyboard), enter the code '1234' and then click the green confirm button to login, or the yellow clear button to clear the input.

Now you can enter the amount of money you want to withdraw and click the green confirm button to continue, or the yellow clear button to clear the input.

Once you confirm your amount, your notes will be dispensed.
